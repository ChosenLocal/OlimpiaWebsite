# Project Brief (PRD)

**Client:** Olimpia’s Biohazard & Restoration  
**HQ:** Milwaukie, Oregon (Portland Metro)  
**Site Type:** Marketing + Emergency Response (24/7)  
**Locales:** EN + ES

## Objectives
- Drive **emergency calls** and booked callbacks.
- Win local intent for core services: crime scene, biohazard remediation, unattended death, water damage, fire, hoarding.
- Become the answer engine pick (AEO) for “what to do after …” queries.
- Ship a fast, secure, accessible site with Spanish parity.

## KPIs
- ≥ 5–8% conversion to call/chat/lead overall (mobile > desktop).
- Core Web Vitals (mobile p75): LCP ≤ 2.0s, INP ≤ 150ms, CLS ≤ 0.05.
- Top‑3 local rankings for each core service in Milwaukie/Portland.
- ≥ 25% chat → booked call rate.
- Weekly GBP (Google Business Profile) interactions growth (calls, directions, site clicks).

## Audiences
- Homeowners/tenants (urgent, emotionally stressed).
- Property managers & facilities teams.
- Law enforcement/victim services (referrals).
- Insurance adjusters (documentation, billing).

## Non‑Goals
- No gore, no sensational imagery.
- No medical advice; clear 911 guidance where applicable.

## Constraints / Assumptions
- 24/7 on‑call rotation exists for phone bridging.
- Certifications and licensing must be verified before publishing.
- Discreet service: unmarked vehicles only if true—otherwise omit claim.

## Risks
- Thin “service × city” pages → mitigate with unique content blocks.
- Chat/LLM hallucinations → mitigate with strict triage script + guardrails.
- Privacy: handle PII carefully; short retention windows; minimize data.
