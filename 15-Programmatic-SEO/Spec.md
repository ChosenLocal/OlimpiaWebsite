# Programmatic SEO — Service × City Spec

## Source Data
- `service` and `city` documents in CMS; joins produce pages.

## Template Blocks
- Unique intro (120–180 words) written for the city.
- Local resources (link out to police/victim services **after verification**).
- 3–5 FAQs unique to city service trends.
- CTA and NAP consistent with main site.

## Safeguards
- No auto‑generate without editorial pass.
- Similarity threshold: flag if >70% similarity with existing pages.
- Canonical to self; add breadcrumb schema; internal links to parent service and nearby cities.
